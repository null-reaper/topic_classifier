# topic_classifier
A naive bayes classifier trained on speeches given by democratic/republic politicians

The dataset consists of 2 text files (train.txt and test.txt) each containing a label RED (for republican) or 
BLUE (for democratic) followed by a tab character and the corresponding speech on each line. The training
dataset contains 46 such examples, while there are 18 in the test setâ€”the labels are evenly distributed.

The naive bayes classifier estimates the probability p(label|words) by first computing p(label) and p(words|label);
probability calculations are performed in log space and add-one smoothing is applied to improve results.

The output when evaluating the classifier on the test dataset were as follows: <br />

overall accuracy: 0.9444444444444444 <br />
precision for red: 0.8571428571428571 <br />
precision for blue: 1.0 <br />
recall for red: 1.0 <br />
recall for blue: 0.9166666666666666
